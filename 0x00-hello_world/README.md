# 0x00. C - Hello, World

## 0.Preprocessor
A bash script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.

```
gcc -E $CFILE -o c

// the -E flag runs the preprocessor only
// the $CFILE is a Linux variable containing the name of the C file to be preprocessed
// the -o flag followed by the file name 'c', defines the name of the output file
```
